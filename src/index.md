Hey there!

My name is Jason, I'm a frontend web developer that used to work at a start up that's known for selling books and shipping things in 2 days.

The purpose of this website is to motivate myself to write more and to learn 11ty because something we web developers tend to not realize is that not everything has to be written in React. I don't know what I'll write about yet but expect guides and tutorials about tech and whatever other thoughts I feel the need to write about.
