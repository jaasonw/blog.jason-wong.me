Hey there!

My name is Jason, I reset passwords and unlock Active Directory accounts. In the past I've worked at a cloud computing start up that's known for sellng books and shipping things really fast.

The purpose of this website is for me to write more and post guides on random stuff I find interesting and learn some off meta tech because the only thing anyone seems to care about is React. I'm interested in self hosting/infra, AI, cooking, personal finance, and lifting so maybe expect content related to those.
